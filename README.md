# housing-prices-advanced-regression
Kaggle's housing prices competition. Uses stacked learners to improve accuracy. (WIP)

This is an abridged version of my Kaggle submission; it only validates and tests against the provided training data. The notebook walks through several techniques to clean and normalize the data; then it tests several different algorithsm. Lastly, it uses an ensemble of stacked learners to maximize the r-squared score.

Competition description:

*Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.*

*With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.*
